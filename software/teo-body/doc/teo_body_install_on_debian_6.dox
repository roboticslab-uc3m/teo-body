 * \page teo_body_install_on_debian_6 Installation from Source Code (Debian 6.0)

 * @section install_teo_body_why Why Debian 6.0?

Your OS needs the following (Debian 6.0 is a good intermediate solution in versions, and Debian is additionally more stable than Ubuntu):
  \li A kernel old enough for the HicoCAN kernel drivers.
  \li An OS new enough for github (you need a recent git version) and YARP (you need a recent CMake version).

 * @section install_teo_body Install the Software

First install the depencencies:
  \li \ref teo_body_install_cmake_on_debian_6
  \li \ref teo_body_install_yarp_on_debian_6

Our software integrates the previous dependencies. Note that you will be prompted for your password upon using '''sudo''' a couple of times:

\verbatim
svn co http://robots.uc3m.es/svn/TEOrepo/software/teo-body  # Download teo-body software from the repository
cd teo-body; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..  # Configure the teo-body software
make  # Compile
sudo make install  # Install :-)
\endverbatim

For additional TEO options use ccmake instead of cmake.

@section install_on_debian_6_even_more Even more!

Done! You are now probably interested in one of the following links:
  \li \ref teo_body_post_install
  \li \ref teo_body_environment_variables
