 * \page teo_body_install_cmake_on_debian_6 Install CMake (Debian 6.0)

We use CMake for project generating. Installing CMake on Debian should be quite straightforward. Note that you will be prompted for your password upon using '''sudo'''. Type:

\verbatim
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui  # Recommended, as it contains ccmake.
\endverbatim
